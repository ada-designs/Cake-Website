Cake Website Project 

For this project, I designed and developed a custom cake ordering website for a client. The goal was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly platform that allows customers to seamlessly order personalized cakes while showcasing the bakery’s creations.

Key Features & Enhancements:
▶ Advanced Order Form – A detailed form with multiple fields and options for full cake customization, including flavor, filling, decoration, and delivery date.
▶ Modern & Elegant Design – Styled to reflect the bakery’s brand and sweet aesthetics.
▶ User-Friendly Navigation – Ensures a smooth and intuitive browsing and ordering experience.
▶ Responsive Layout – Optimized for all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
▶ Performance Optimization – Fast load times and efficient code despite the complex form.

Key Skills Developed:
▶ Dynamic Form Handling – Implemented a fully customizable form with validations.
▶ UX & UI Optimization – Focused on accessibility and an intuitive ordering experience.
▶ Performance Tuning – Ensured the site remains fast and responsive with multiple form options.
▶ Mobile-First Design – Applied responsive design principles for seamless use on all screen sizes.

This project not only strengthened my web development skills but also deepened my understanding of e-commerce functionality and customer-centric UI design.
